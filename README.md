# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Customer-Review-Datasets-for-Yelp-IMDB-and-Amazon-with-PyTorch_and_RNN

I perform the classification task on the customer review datasets from Yelp, IMDB, and Amazon as the positive or negative review using the Embedding layer and the Recurrent Neural Network. 

We can see that the accuracy on the test data is 76.3%. This means that actually the Convolutional Neural Network model with the Embedding layer performs better than the Recurrent Neural Network model with the Embedding layer in classifying the customer reveiw as the positive review or the negative review.
